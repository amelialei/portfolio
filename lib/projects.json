The study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and missing data analysis, revealing insights like lower sodium recipes receiving higher ratings. I also built a predictive model to estimate recipe ratings based on ingredients, nutrition, and cooking time. "

        "description": "I predicted Ethereumâ€™s closing price and price trends using machine learning. Data preprocessing included 10-minute aggregation, log-transforming volume, and MinMax scaling. A polynomial linear regression (degree 4) was used first, followed by a decision tree regressor, which improved accuracy. I also built a decision tree classifier to predict price increases with moderate accuracy. The project involved hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance visualization."

This includes functions to fetch and tokenize a book from a URL, and various classes for different types of language models: UniformLM, UnigramLM, and NGramLM. The UniformLM and UnigramLM models calculate probabilities based on token frequency and generate random text based on these probabilities. The NGramLM model works with n-grams (sequences of n words), calculating conditional probabilities for word sequences and using a recursive approach to handle higher-order n-grams. "

        "description": "I examined how employment length, income, and loan amount impact loan approval rates for young (18-28) vs. mid-career adults (28-38), focusing on education level. Using scatter plots and a categorical bar plot, I analyzed key relationships and conducted T-tests for significance. Results showed that education level has little impact on loan amounts, but mid-career adults are significantly more likely to repay loans, likely due to greater financial stability and literacy."

        "description": "Designed and developed an interactive scrollytelling visualization using D3.js to illustrate glucose responses to meals across individuals with varying diabetes statuses and gut health levels. Integrated real CGM data to show time-based glucose curves for different carb intakes (low, medium, high). Enabled user exploration through clickable buttons and smooth animated transitions, highlighting the impact of nutrition and microbiome on metabolic response.",

        "description": "Built a game recommendation system using both Categorical Naive Bayes and a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model. Preprocessed Steam game and user data to engineer features like genre, price tier, playtime, and recommendation history. The Naive Bayes model achieved 81.8% accuracy by predicting the probability of user recommendation based on categorical inputs, while the HMM modeled hidden user preference states (e.g., casual gamer, genre-focused gamer) to generate personalized game recommendations based on observed behavior and state transitions."

        "description": "Conducted statistical analysis on gender disparities in STEM and Computer Science graduation rates across 9 UC campuses from 2017–2022. Compared schools near major tech hubs to those farther away using regression, ARIMA time series forecasting, and hypothesis testing. Found significantly higher female representation in tech hub campuses and projected trends using time-based models. Used regression to evaluate predictors of graduation trends and tested gender proportions across groups using Z-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests."

        "description": "This project analyzes recipe data from food.com containing 83,782 recipes and 731,927 reviews to uncover trends in preparation time, nutrition, and user ratings. The study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and missing data analysis, revealing insights like lower sodium recipes receiving higher ratings. I also built a predictive model to estimate recipe ratings based on ingredients, nutrition, and cooking time. "

The app fetches and displays the current weather and a forecast for the user's location based on their IP address. It provides key weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, and sunrise/sunset times for the current and next day."

        "description": "I predicted Ethereum’s closing price and price trends using machine learning. Data preprocessing included 10-minute aggregation, log-transforming volume, and MinMax scaling. A polynomial linear regression (degree 4) was used first, followed by a decision tree regressor, which improved accuracy. I also built a decision tree classifier to predict price increases with moderate accuracy. The project involved hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance visualization."

        "description": "Created a series of language models for processing and generating text. This includes functions to fetch and tokenize a book from a URL, and various classes for different types of language models: UniformLM, UnigramLM, and NGramLM. The UniformLM and UnigramLM models calculate probabilities based on token frequency and generate random text based on these probabilities. The NGramLM model works with n-grams (sequences of n words), calculating conditional probabilities for word sequences and using a recursive approach to handle higher-order n-grams. "

        "description": "I examined how employment length, income, and loan amount impact loan approval rates for young (18-28) vs. mid-career adults (28-38), focusing on education level. Using scatter plots and a categorical bar plot, I analyzed key relationships and conducted T-tests for significance. Results showed that education level has little impact on loan amounts, but mid-career adults are significantly more likely to repay loans, likely due to greater financial stability and literacy."

        "description": "This project analyzes recipe data from food.com containing 83,782 recipes and 731,927 reviews to uncover trends in preparation time, nutrition, and user ratings. The study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and missing data analysis, revealing insights like lower sodium recipes receiving higher ratings. I also built a predictive model to estimate recipe ratings based on ingredients, nutrition, and cooking time. "

        "description": "I predicted Ethereumâ€™s closing price and price trends using machine learning. Data preprocessing included 10-minute aggregation, log-transforming volume, and MinMax scaling. A polynomial linear regression (degree 4) was used first, followed by a decision tree regressor, which improved accuracy. I also built a decision tree classifier to predict price increases with moderate accuracy. The project involved hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance visualization."

This includes functions to fetch and tokenize a book from a URL, and various classes for different types of language models: UniformLM, UnigramLM, and NGramLM. The UniformLM and UnigramLM models calculate probabilities based on token frequency and generate random text based on these probabilities. The NGramLM model works with n-grams (sequences of n words), calculating conditional probabilities for word sequences and using a recursive approach to handle higher-order n-grams. "

        "description": "I examined how employment length, income, and loan amount impact loan approval rates for young (18-28) vs. mid-career adults (28-38), focusing on education level. Using scatter plots and a categorical bar plot, I analyzed key relationships and conducted T-tests for significance. Results showed that education level has little impact on loan amounts, but mid-career adults are significantly more likely to repay loans, likely due to greater financial stability and literacy."

I also created an ImageProcessingTemplate class with methods for negating, grayscaling, and rotating images. Additionally, I extended this template to develop StandardImageProcessing and PremiumImageProcessing classes, which introduced cost-based processing and advanced features like chroma keying. The project focused on object-oriented design, deep copying techniques, and efficient pixel manipulation."

The program loads compressed MNIST image and label data, processes it into a structured format, and applies the Euclidean distance metric to classify test images based on their k-nearest neighbors in the training set. A priority queue is used to efficiently store and retrieve the closest matches. The classifier is tested on a subset of the MNIST dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated."

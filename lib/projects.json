The study involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and missing data analysis, revealing insights like lower sodium recipes receiving higher ratings. I also built a predictive model to estimate recipe ratings based on ingredients, nutrition, and cooking time. "

A polynomial linear regression (degree 4) was used first, followed by a decision tree regressor, which improved accuracy. I also built a decision tree classifier to predict price increases with moderate accuracy. The project involved hyperparameter tuning, feature importance analysis, and performance visualization."

The UniformLM and UnigramLM models calculate probabilities based on token frequency and generate random text based on these probabilities. The NGramLM model works with n-grams (sequences of n words), calculating conditional probabilities for word sequences and using a recursive approach to handle higher-order n-grams. "

Using scatter plots and a categorical bar plot, I analyzed key relationships and conducted T-tests for significance. Results showed that education level has little impact on loan amounts, but mid-career adults are significantly more likely to repay loans, likely due to greater financial stability and literacy."

The program loads compressed MNIST image and label data, processes it into a structured format, and applies the Euclidean distance metric to classify test images based on their k-nearest neighbors in the training set. A priority queue is used to efficiently store and retrieve the closest matches. The classifier is tested on a subset of the MNIST dataset, and its accuracy is evaluated."
